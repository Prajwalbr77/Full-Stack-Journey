    <h1><span>Ozymandias</span></h1>
    <!-- Poest's Name -->
     <h3>By percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
     <!-- Poem -->
      <p>I met a traveller from an antilque land <br>who said -"Two vast and 
    trunkless legs of stone <br>
stand in the desert.... Near them,on the sand,<br>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies,whoes frown,<br>
And wrinkled lip ,and sneer of cold command <br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
Which yet survive,stamped on  these lifeless things,<br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
My name is Ozymandias,king of kings; <br>
Look on my works,ye mighty, and despair! <br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
Of that colossal Wreck,boundless and bare <br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away." <br>
</p>
